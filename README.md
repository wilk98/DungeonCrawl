Roguelikes are one of the oldest types of video games. The earliest ones were made in the 70s, and they were inspired a lot by tabletop RPGs. Roguelikes usually have the following features in common.

- They are tile-based.
- The game is divided into turns, that is, you take one action, then the other entities (monsters, allies, and so on, controlled by the CPU) take one.
- The task is usually to explore a labyrinth and retrieve some treasure from its bottom.
- They feature permadeath: if you die, it's game over, you need to start from the beginning again.
- They rely heavily on procedural generation: Levels, monster placement, items, and so on are randomized, so the game does not get boring.

Your character must find a way out of the maze. 
Along the way, she will fight against countless enemies. 
Collect items, level up and find the exit to win the game!
